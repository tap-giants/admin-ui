## Installation

```
yarn add @tap-giants/admin-ui
```

## Usage and examples

TBD. In the meantime just check the `src` folder.

## Styles

TBD. Styles should live in a separate package?

## Development

Link the package from your target project and run `yarn start`. This will start the webpacker watcher.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, use `yarn publish` to push the new version to npmjs.org.
